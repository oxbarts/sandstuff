## Wizard

<Wizard/>


## Alternatives

You don't have to use the form above. There are other ways to get that information.


### Console snippet

Open your browser's console with F12 and paste the following code. Only works when you're on the Sandbox website and logged in. **Please make sure to understand what you do. Pasting and executing unknown code can be dangerous.**

<Code code={snippet}/>


### Network tab

While visiting the AS6 dashboard on the Sandbox website at <a href="https://www.sandbox.game/en/events/alpha-season-6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.sandbox.game/en/events/alpha-season-6/</a>, have a look at your browser dev tool's network tab and search for an entry called *user-data?filter=all*.


### Raw JSON
Open <a href="https://api.sandbox.game/experiences/social-event/515/user-data?filter=all" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://api.sandbox.game/experiences/social-event/515/user-data?filter=all</a> (yep, that's the data from the wizard) and read the JSON manually.
